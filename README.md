# Li-Fi Data Communications in a Vehicular Fog

## Objective
This Saint Leo University cornerstone project allow undergraduates to explore emerging trends within information technology. Undergraduates are to take any emerging trends of their choosing and examine a potential cross section of such trends that may benefit humanity. 

### Project 
<p>  Our futures are moving in the direction of the ‘smart city’ environment.  This also means a more complex roadside environment with smart vehicles both man an unmanned. These vehicles are expected to be connected, in a ‘vehicular fog’. Vehicular fog is defined as a total data communications network between vehicles and roadside management systems (Lee et al., 2016). This network is comprised of multi-spectral and spatial smart sensors. However, these systems are susceptible to challenges. To introduce safety through security, it is proposed to introduce Li-Fi data communications between these vehicles and Roadside Devices (Lee et al., 2016). This will present various benefits in a roadside environment that has both automated vehicles and manned vehicles.</p>

#### Brief Component Explanation
<p><i>&nbsp;The Vehicular Fog Model, with emphasis on Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles (AUV’s)</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;At this moment, we employ smart, manned, vehicles, daily. Lee et al. (2016) mentions they are a formidable sensor platform (utilizing lidar, radar, EO, sonic, INS, GPS) absorbing information from the environment and feeding it to drivers and infrastructure to assist in safe navigation, pollution control, and traffic management. The next step in this evolution is just around the corner:  Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles. AUV’s interconnected in an Internet of Vehicles of sorts, a vehicular fog (Lee et al., 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Lee et al. (2016) continues to explain that when these AUV’s have intentional smart-sensor use, cloud computing-processing, collaborative sharing of this spatial information, and a well-maintained network infrastructure, this will be called vehicular fog. The main goal is to promptly deliver passengers safely to their destinations (Lee et al., 2016).</p>

The main goal is to promptly deliver passengers safely to their destinations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The AUV’s have a constant receive-request-transmit of spatial data when departing dense urban areas, upwards to several kilometers to have a good course, in order to eventually join a fleet on a highway, where the vehicular fog is at this strength, and in communication with RSU’s on the road (Lee et al., 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Lee, et al. proposes that vehicular fog will be an adhoc network among the vehicles in proximity, due to the vehicles leaving and joining networks frequently. For protocol and addressing functions, a content-naming host is utilized, instead of internet protocol address. Named data networking (NDN) is consider the model architecture for this format. This will theoretically give the AUV’s, within a vehicular fog, certain assignment sensory and data-processing duty among an adhoc fleet. Each AUV will have three categories of resources: data storage (supports data sharing between fog connected vehicles), sensors (all connected to the IoV to be read and controlled), and computing. Depending on proximity to an RSU, either one AUV on the fog can self-organize a local vehicular fog environment and assign roles (like data cache, etc.) to other vehicles around itself. Here, it is proposed to allow Li-Fi usage, so data-sharing clock speeds can be sped up.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;Light Fidelity Data Communications in Brief</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;Light Fidelity, or Li-Fi, is a visible light communications technology. It is a bidirectional and fully networked wireless communications medium which uses light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and provides transmission of data through illumination by sending data through a LED light bulb that varies in intensity faster than the human eye can follow (Yeasmin et al., 2016). This varying intensity, in nanoseconds, is how data is transmitted, in a binary format.  The light bandwidth can be measured at multiple tera-hertz, at 10 Gbps (Hernandez-Oregon et al., 2019). Visible light has ten thousand times more real estate on the Electromagnetic Spectrum than radio frequency energy, x-rays, or gamma-rays (Hernandez-Oregon et al., 2019; Islim et al., 2018). The Visible light bandwidth measures in the range of 380-750 nanometers (Hernandez-Oregon et al., 2019).  With a small microchip, and the presence of a receiver, any of the 14 plus billion lightbulbs worldwide could be made in a transmitter (Haas, 2011). The receiver is only interested in subtle data changes, so other light sources won’t affect it much (Haas, 2011). However, in sunlight may pose small amount of interference as ‘shot noise’, but not outright interference (Islim et al., 2018).</p>

<p>&nbsp; Hernandez-Oregon, et al. have successful conducted a viable study that used a traffic light server model that then transmits pertinent data to queues of stationary cars, that in turn transmits data from head-to-taillight fashion through said queue.</p>
