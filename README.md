# Li-Fi Data Communications in a Vehicular Fog

## Objective
This Saint Leo University cornerstone project allow undergraduates to explore emerging trends within information technology. Undergraduates are to take any emerging trends of their choosing and examine a potential cross section of such trends that may benefit humanity. 

## Project 
<p>  Our futures are moving in the direction of the ‘smart city’ environment.  This also means a more complex roadside environment with smart vehicles both man an unmanned. These vehicles are expected to be connected, in a ‘vehicular fog’. Vehicular fog is defined as a total data communications network between vehicles and roadside management systems (Lee et al., 2016). This network is comprised of multi-spectral and spatial smart sensors. However, these systems are susceptible to challenges. To introduce safety through security, it is proposed to introduce Li-Fi data communications between these vehicles and Roadside Devices (Lee et al., 2016). This will present various benefits in a roadside environment that has both automated vehicles and manned vehicles.</p>
